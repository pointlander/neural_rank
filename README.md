# Neural Rank
This is an implementation of non-linear [page rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). Page rank can be defined by the equation `AX = X` where `A` is an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix), and `X` is the vector of the page ranks. This equation can be altered to be non-linear with a non-linear function `f`: `f(Af(AX)) = X`. This is a two layer [recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) [auto encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) which can be solved for `X` using [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent). It is recurrent because the `A` weights are reused in the second layer. The implementation of this algorithm tends to produce results similar to page rank. A complex number version is also provided and tends to produce results less like page rank.
